# Project Two: Dashboard and CRUD Module

## Reflection

### How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
When writing programs, I focus on clear structure and modularity to ensure that my code is maintainable, readable, and adaptable. For example, in Project One, I developed a CRUD Python module that adhered to the principles of encapsulation by separating database operations into distinct functions such as `create`, `read`, `update`, and `delete`. This modular approach made it easier to debug and extend the functionality, allowing for the same module to be reused in Project Two to connect the dashboard widgets to the database.

The advantages of working this way include easier maintenance, as code changes or improvements can be localized within a module without affecting other components. It also facilitates readability for future developers who may work on the codebase, as each function is designed to perform a single, well-defined task. The CRUD module could be repurposed in future projects to interact with other databases, whether for administrative dashboards, data processing, or even integrating with web services.

### How do you approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I approach problems systematically, breaking them down into smaller, manageable components. For the Grazioso Salvare dashboard project, I started by understanding the requirements for the database queries and dashboard components. I first implemented the database connection using the CRUD module, then moved on to building the interactive dashboard with filtering options. This approach ensured that each step was functional before proceeding to the next phase.

Compared to previous assignments, this project required more complex data manipulation, so I used aggregation pipelines and data visualization techniques to meet the requirements. In the future, I would continue to use a modular approach to design databases and user interfaces, integrating testing early on to verify that each component meets the client's needs. I would also employ version control to track changes and collaborate more effectively with other developers.

### What do computer scientists do, and why does it matter?
Computer scientists solve real-world problems by developing software solutions that improve efficiency and effectiveness. In the context of this project, I developed a dashboard for Grazioso Salvare, allowing them to better manage and visualize their animal data. By providing filtering options and a geolocation map, I made it easier for the company to identify suitable rescue animals based on specific criteria, ultimately helping them streamline their operations.

The work of computer scientists matters because it enables organizations to leverage data for informed decision-making, automate tedious tasks, and improve the user experience for customers. In this project, my contributions helped Grazioso Salvare to manage animal data more effectively, which could lead to better outcomes in their rescue operations.
